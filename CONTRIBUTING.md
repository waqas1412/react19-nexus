## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript mode
- Avoid `any` types; prefer proper typing
- Use interfaces for object shapes
- Use type aliases for unions and complex types

### React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow React 19+ best practices
- Leverage new features: Actions, useActionState, useOptimistic, use API, etc.
- Write accessible components (ARIA, keyboard navigation)

### Styling

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Follow the design system defined in `tailwind.config.js`
- Ensure responsive design
- Maintain high contrast ratios for accessibility

### Code Organization

- Follow SOLID principles
- Keep components small and focused (Single Responsibility)
- Use composition over inheritance
- Apply DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Create reusable utilities and hooks

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features
- Aim for high test coverage
- Use React Testing Library best practices
- Test accessibility features
